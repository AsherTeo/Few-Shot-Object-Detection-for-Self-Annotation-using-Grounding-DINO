## 1. Introduction

In traditional computer vision workflows, dataset annotation is often the most time-consuming step. Manually drawing bounding boxes for thousands of images quickly becomes a bottleneck, especially for domain-specific objects where pre-trained models may not generalize well.

Although modern vision models are trained on large-scale data and many works have explored zero-shot detection to reduce labeling effort, in practice the recall is often too low for reliable self-annotation. Missed objects and excessive false positives still require substantial human correction, limiting the usefulness of purely zero-shot approaches.

By introducing a small amount of labeled data, few-shot learning can improve detection recall and provide better pre-annotations. This project studies a recall-oriented few-shot approach with human-in-the-loop as Stage 1 of an annotation pipeline. The refined annotations can then be used to train a fully supervised detector (e.g., YOLO or RF-DETR) as Stage 2 for improved final performance.
